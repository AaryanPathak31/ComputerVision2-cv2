# ComputerVision2-cv2

This repository documents my journey of learning **OpenCV (cv2)**, a powerful library for computer vision. It contains hands-on examples, tutorials, and projects that cover various computer vision techniques and concepts.

## Features
- **Image Processing**: Learn about filtering, transformations, and edge detection.
- **Video Analysis**: Work with real-time video streams and motion tracking.
- **Object Detection**: Explore detection methods using pre-trained models.
- **Code Examples**: Easy-to-follow examples to reinforce understanding.

## Note
**1**: I Learned About Basics of OpenCV2 with Python.
**2**: It is completely Beginner Frielndly!
**3**: Learned Concept include:
                -Basics
